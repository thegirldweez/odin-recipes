    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li>1 lb sweet potatoes (about 2 medium sized)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, <em>softened to room temperature</em></li>
      <li>1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>2/3 can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="directions-list">
      <li><strong>Pie crust</strong>: I like to make sure my pie dough is prepared before I begin making this pie. Make pie dough the night before
      because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before rolling out (step 3).</li>
      <li><strong>As the pie dough chills, start the sweet potatoes</strong>: Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan. Cover them with water, then
      bring to a boil on the stove top. Boil for 45-50 minutes, or until super soft. During this time, begin step 3.</li>
      <li><strong>Roll out the chilled pie dough</strong>: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the disks of chilled dough (use the 2nd pie
      crust for another recipe or freeze). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle
      12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is
      completely smooth. To make a lovely thick edge, I do not trim excess dough around the edges. Instead, fold the excess
      dough back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into a nice thick rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with
      a fork or use your fingers to flute the edges. Brush edges with egg wash. Chill the dough in the refrigerator or freezer
      for at least 15 minutes as you work on the filling– this helps prevent the crust from shrinking.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
      <li>Drain the boiling water and run the potatoes under very cold water. The skin should peel off easily at this point. Cool
      for a few minutes until easy to handle. Slice the potatoes into a couple large chunks, then place into a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li><strong>For the filling</strong>: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment (or you can use a blender for
      this), beat/blend the potatoes on medium-high speed until smooth. Add the remaining filling ingredients (down to and
      including the salt) and beat/blend on high speed until smooth and combined. Spread filling into prepared pie crust.</li>
      <li>Bake for 55-60 minutes or until the center of the pie is only slightly jiggly. A toothpick inserted into the center of
      the pie should come out *mostly* clean. During bake time, if you find the edges of the pie crust are browning too
      quickly, apply a pie crust shield or a ring of aluminum foil to protect it.Remove finished pie from the oven. Place on a
      wire rack to cool completely or for at least 2 hours. The pie filling will sink and set as it cools. Decorate with
      whipped cream or other toppings of choice.</li>
      <li>Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
